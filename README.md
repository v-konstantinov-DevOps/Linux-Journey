# 🐧 Linux Learning Journey

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal Linux learning repository. I'm currently studying Linux through [LinuxJourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/) and documenting everything I learn in a structured and practical way.

This repo includes:
- 📚 Notes and summaries by topic
- ⚙️ Practical commands and usage examples
- 🧪 Bash scripts and terminal exercises
- 🗓️ A learning diary with daily progress
